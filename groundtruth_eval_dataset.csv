What is the primary use of A-mode ultrasound in medical imaging?,"page_content='waves are blocked or become randomly scattered.
Four different modes of ultrasound are used in med-
ical imaging:
• A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in
which a single transducer scans a line through the body
with the echoes plotted on screen as a function of
depth. This method is used to measure distances within
the body and the size of internal organs. Therapeutic
ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also

• B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of trans-
ducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body
that can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on
screen. Ultrasound probes containing more than 100
transducers in sequence form the basis for these most
commonly used scanners, which cost about $50,000.
