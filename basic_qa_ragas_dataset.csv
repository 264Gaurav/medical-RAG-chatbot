The provided context only discusses viruses, specifically retroviruses like HIV, and does not mention prions or their replication mechanisms. Prions are infectious proteins that replicate through a different mechanism than viruses.","['urine)\n• by transmission during pregnancy,o r\n• through transfusion of infected blood products\nA retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme\ncalled reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-\nin new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,\nwhich is found on the surface of certain subtypes of white\nblood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, and\nmonocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate and'
 'act by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase.\nBecause a retrovirus is composed of RNA, the virus must\nmake a DNA strand in order to replicate itself. Reverse\ntranscriptase is an enzyme that is essential to making the\nDNA copy. The nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors are incorporated into the DNA strand. This is a\nfaulty DNA molecule which is incapable of reproducing.\nThe non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase in-\nhibitors (NNRTIs), such as delavirdine (Rescriptor),'
